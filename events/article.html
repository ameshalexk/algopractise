<p>A Fort Worth, Texas, police officer fatally shot an unarmed Black woman during the early hours of Saturday morning.</p>

<p>Identified as Atatiana Jefferson, the 28-year-old victim was reportedly home watching her <a href="https://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/fort-worth/article236067328.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">eight-year-old nephew</a>, when law enforcement entered the residence in response to a standard welfare check. Called in by neighbor James Smith, the routine check was initiated over concerns for Jefferson&#39;s safety, after Smith noticed the front door of her home had been left ajar.</p>

<p>In the aftermath of the tragic incident, Smith expressed his regrets about calling the authorities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m shaken. I&rsquo;m mad. I&rsquo;m upset. And I feel it&rsquo;s partly my fault,&rdquo;<a href="https://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/fort-worth/article236067328.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> he told</a>&nbsp;<em>The&nbsp;</em><em>Fort Worth Star-Telegram.</em>&nbsp;&ldquo;If I had never dialed the police department, she&rsquo;d still be alive.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>According to <em>Fort Worth Star-Telegram</em>, police bodycam footage reveals two officers checking the perimeter of the property with flashlights. As one officer makes his way to the back of the house, he seemingly responds to movement from &quot;a figure through a dark window.&quot;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;&#39;Put your hands up! Show me your hands!&#39; he shouts through the window, his gun drawn. He then fires a single shot through the window. In the video, he does not identify himself as an officer,&quot;&nbsp;<em>Fort Worth Star-Telegram</em>&nbsp;reported.</p>

	<p>The &quot;dark figure&quot; has now been purported to be Jefferson, who had been playing video games with her nephew, when she overheard a mysterious sound &mdash; the sound of police entering her backyard in the wee hours of the morning.&nbsp;</p>

		<p dir="ltr" lang="en">A North Texas cop just murdered another law abiding citizen in their home. Her name was <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AtatianaJefferson?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AtatianaJefferson</a> &ldquo;Tay&rdquo;. She was playing video games with her 8y/o nephew, when they heard a noise in the backyard. When Tay went to investigate, she was shot to death. <a href="https://t.co/mFJ1O2TNMK">pic.twitter.com/mFJ1O2TNMK</a></p>&mdash; S. Lee Merritt, Esq.

	<p>According to CNN, the officer then opened fire on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/12/us/fort-worth-police-shooting/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">person they saw through&nbsp;the window</a>. A&nbsp;Tarrant County Medical Examiner concluded Jefferson died around 2:30 a.m. Saturday morning in the bedroom. The department <a href="https://dfw.cbslocal.com/2019/10/12/fort-worth-police-officer-shoots-kills-woman-inside-her-own-home/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has yet to release the name of the officer.</a> However, authorities did confirm the officer was Caucasian and has been on the force since April 2018.&nbsp;</p>

	<p>Obvious parallels between the news of Jefferson&#39;s death and the recent killing of <a href="https://blavity.com/juror-selection-underway-for-ex-cop-amber-guyger-in-fatal-shooting-of-botham-jean" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Botham Jean</a>, another unarmed Black person whose demise came&nbsp;at the hands of Texas police,&nbsp;has inspired many to take to social media, distraught and outraged over yet another police-involved shooting.&nbsp;</p>

	<p>Fort Worth Mayor Betsy Price released a statement, sending her condolences to the victim&#39;s family.&nbsp;</p>

	<p>&quot;Writing a statement like this is tragic and something that should never be necessary,&quot; <a href="http://www.wbap.com/2019/10/12/officer-involved-shooting-in-fort-worth-one-person-reported-dead/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Price reportedly texted </a>to a <em>WBAP/KLIF News</em> reporter. &quot;A young woman has lost her life, leaving her family in unbelievable grief. All of Fort Worth must surround Atatiana Jefferson&rsquo;s family with prayers, love and support. Chief Kraus and his command staff are acting with immediacy and transparency to conduct a complete and thorough investigation. More details are forthcoming and the Tarrant County District Attorney Law Enforcement Incident Team office will ultimately receive this case.&quot;</p>

	<p>The officer responsible for the shooting has been placed on administrative leave pending an internal investigation.</p>
